# File Processing System with Multiprocessing and Multithreading

## Introduction

In modern computing, efficient processing of large datasets is crucial for optimizing system performance. This project aims to explore two widely-used parallel processing techniques: **multiprocessing** and **multithreading**. Specifically, the project involves developing a file processing system that counts the frequency of specific words in large text files using both techniques. Each file is processed in parallel using child processes, and within each process, multiple threads are employed to enhance performance by splitting the file into smaller chunks for concurrent processing.

This project also incorporates **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)** to manage communication between processes. The performance of multiprocessing and multithreading is measured in terms of execution time, CPU usage, and memory consumption. By analyzing these metrics, the project seeks to compare the efficiency, resource utilization, and scalability of both approaches.

## Project Overview

This system processes multiple large files in parallel using **multiprocessing** and **multithreading** to efficiently count word frequencies. Each large text file is processed in a separate process, created using `fork()`. Within each process, multiple threads are created to further divide the file into smaller chunks for parallel word counting.

### Key Steps:
- **Process Creation**: The system uses `fork()` to create child processes, with each child responsible for processing a single file.
- **Multithreading**: Threads within each process read and process sections of the file in parallel to enhance performance.
- **Inter-Process Communication (IPC)**: The child processes send word count results to the parent process using an IPC mechanism (e.g., pipes, message queues, or shared memory).

### System Design Overview:
1. **Processes**: Each file is processed by a child process.
2. **Threads**: Each child process uses multiple threads to process chunks of the file.
3. **IPC**: Results from child processes are sent to the parent process for final aggregation.

This system allows us to compare the performance of multiprocessing and multithreading in terms of execution time, CPU usage, and memory consumption.

## Process Management

Process creation is handled using the `fork()` system call, which allows the system to create child processes to process each file independently. Each child process is assigned a single file from the directory. The parent process manages the child processes and collects their results once they finish processing.

### Steps in Process Management:
1. The parent process reads the directory containing the files and forks a new child process for each file.
2. Each child process is responsible for processing one file and using multithreading to divide the work.
3. The parent process waits for all child processes to complete their work, and then aggregates the results communicated via IPC.
4. Proper synchronization mechanisms (e.g., `wait()`) are employed to ensure the parent process correctly handles the completion of child processes.

The use of multiprocessing ensures that each file is processed in parallel, allowing for faster overall execution.

## Multithreading

Within each child process, the file is divided into several chunks, each assigned to a separate thread for processing. By using **POSIX threads (pthreads)**, multiple threads work concurrently within the same process to speed up word counting for large files.

### Key Details:
1. **Thread Creation**: Each child process creates multiple threads that operate on different parts of the file.
2. **File Splitting**: The file is split into equal-sized chunks (based on the number of threads), and each thread processes a chunk.
3. **Word Counting**: Each thread counts the frequency of the specified word(s) in its chunk of the file.
4. **Thread Synchronization**: Threads within a process share data such as word counts, and proper synchronization (e.g., mutexes) is required to avoid race conditions.

By comparing single-threaded and multi-threaded approaches within the same process, we can measure the impact of threading on performance.

## Inter-Process Communication (IPC)

To transfer results between child and parent processes, an IPC mechanism is used. This project uses **pipes** to pass word count results from the child processes to the parent process.

### IPC Mechanism Overview:
1. **Pipe Creation**: The parent process creates a pipe before forking the child processes.
2. **Message Passing**: Once the child processes complete their work, they send the word count results back to the parent process via the pipe.
3. **Parent Aggregation**: The parent process reads the data from the pipe and aggregates the word counts for the final result.

The use of IPC ensures that the parent process can receive and combine the results from multiple child processes efficiently.

## Error Handling

Proper error handling is crucial for ensuring the system operates smoothly, especially when dealing with multiple processes and threads. This system implements error handling for the following scenarios:

1. **Process Creation Errors**: If `fork()` fails, the system handles the error by printing a message and terminating the affected process.
2. **Thread Creation Errors**: If thread creation fails, the system logs the error and exits the thread safely.
3. **IPC Errors**: Errors during pipe creation or message passing are caught, and appropriate recovery actions are taken.
4. **File I/O Errors**: The system checks for errors when opening and reading from files, ensuring that invalid files are handled gracefully.

## Performance Evaluation

In this section, we compare the performance of **multiprocessing** and **multithreading** by measuring the following metrics:
1. **Execution Time**: The total time taken to process all files using multiprocessing versus multithreading.
2. **CPU Usage**: The CPU consumption of both techniques is monitored and compared.
3. **Memory Usage**: The memory overhead for multiprocessing and multithreading is analyzed.

In conclusion, this project has demonstrated the benefits and trade-offs of using multiprocessing and multithreading for parallel file processing. While both approaches offer significant performance improvements over a sequential approach, they each have unique advantages in different scenarios. Multiprocessing is advantageous for isolating tasks, whereas multithreading offers better memory efficiency within a single process. The use of IPC enabled efficient communication between processes, further improving the system's robustness.
